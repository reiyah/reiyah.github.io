	          <p>When I was eleven years old, I found out about the existence of a summer math camp named Epsilon. I had always liked math in school, and despite not being exceptionally passionate about the subject at the time, decided to apply to the camp. With a stroke of luck, I ended up getting accepted. I was excited about the opportunity to attend a math camp (something which I had never even heard about before), but also nervous. What if my math abilities weren&rsquo;t on par with the other kids there?</p>
	          <p>My experience at Epsilon was, in short, life changing. In just a short two weeks, I realized that math was much more than the formulas and memorization I had always associated it with. Math was beautiful. In my first year at Epsilon, I learned about hyperbolic geometry and set theory, among much more. Upon leaving, I was striving to know more.</p>
	          <p>Since that time, I have attended math camps every summer. For the past three summers, I have attended the Honors Summer Math Camp (HSMC) at Texas State University, which has also had a profound impact on me. HSMC taught me about number theory, analysis, abstract algebra, and proof-writing, and allowed me to participate in a research project led by Professor Wade Hindes. Along with a research partner, I worked on a soon-to-be-published research paper entitled &ldquo;Irreducible Polynomials in Quadratic Semigroups.&rdquo; The preview of this paper can be seen here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03856">https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03856</a>. </p>
	          <p>An article detailing my feelings about and experiences at HSMC can be found here: <a href="https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/a-students-perspective-honors-summer-math-camp-hsmc/">https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/a-students-perspective-honors-summer-math-camp-hsmc/</a>. This coming summer, I will be a counselor at HSMC, something I&rsquo;m looking forward to very much!</p>
